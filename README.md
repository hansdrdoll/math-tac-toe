#### Tic-tac-toe, but with numbers

Based on [Ron Graham's Numerical Tic-Tac-Toe (pdf)](http://aturing.umcs.maine.edu/~markov/tictactoe.pdf), two players work with either the even or odd integers between 0 and 10, and strategically place numbers on a 3x3 grid. Completing a row, column, or diagonal that totals 15 wins the game!

Made in JavaScript with jQuery.
